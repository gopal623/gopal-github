    "This project is aimed at solving the problem for a current Sydney local resident, in the suburb of ‘Parramatta’, considering moving to Hornsby expecting this place to be sports friendly and have a different living experience compared to Parramatta. The recommendation is based on clustering analysis of the similarities , or the dissimilarities between the current suburb and the recommended suburb, based on how prevalent parks and fitness activities are. The recommendation will compare the suburbs of Parramatta and Hornsby and suggest whether the move to Hornsby will fulfil the aspirations of the Sydney local resident"
